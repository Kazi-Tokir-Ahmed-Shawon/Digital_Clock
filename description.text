This code will create a digital clock that displays the current date and time in real time. 
The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the web page, including a div container with a clock div inside.
The clock div contains two child divs, one to display the date and one to display the time.

The CSS file styles the clock and its child divs, centers the text, and sets the font and size.
It also styles the div container, making it a full-height flexbox with a background image.

The JavaScript file provides the functions for the clock. The getDate() function gets the current
date and formats it as a string and returns the result. The updateTime() function gets the current 
time and formats it as a string, updating the time display on the web page every second using setInterval(). 
The document.querySelector() method is used to select date and time div elements and update their inner HTML 
with formatted date and time strings.

Overall, this code uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple yet functional digital
clock that updates in real time.
